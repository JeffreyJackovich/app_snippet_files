Create an Argparse interface:

"Take the list of arguments 
(for example put list "A sequence of things - created using []"), and split them into named variables
("put", "list", and "A sequence of things - created using []"). 
We will see how to access these variables in a moment."


Putting the pieces together:
Try adding a new snippet using your put command by running python snippets.py put Test "This is a test snippet". Take a look at the log. 
You should see that the snippet is being stored successfully. 
Then run a query on your database to make sure that it has been stored.
